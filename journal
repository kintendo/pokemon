deal w/ dots in the future
next: client side turn ending
ambitious: implement pokemon evolving / benching
super ambitious: implement pokemon attacking!

6/26/2013
uhm, i just discovered console.debug for client side js, what the fuck

6/25/2013
note: sending #{card} from client is bad
	all logic should be handled server-side
	client should just send vague controls
	server side will interpret as source of truth
	anyway, i'll do that later
ncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u means accessing null json var
all socket.io stuff goes through data
retreating done!
next: ending turns

6/24/2013
next: debug retreating

6/21/2013
deck shuffling now appends hand
hand drawing now clears hand
next: finish up retreat logic and tie in client side

6/20/2013
done w/ energy attaching
need to keep track of one energy/turn
prevent player actions not on his or her turn
adding energy and retreat cooldown to gym object
next: add retreating functionality

6/19/2013
maybe onclick can't have dynamic id's?
oh my god i figured it out. fuck.
for some reason, couldn't dynamic popover on id, only a class
energy attaching works
next: show attached cards

6/18/2013
use $(this) to pass the selector
STOP USING SINGLE QUOTES
coffeescript, like php, doesn't interpret single quoted strings
next: figure out popover bug
next: show attached button

6/17/2013
how do i pass an object and then use it as a selector?
next: continue tooltip controls

6/14/2013
allowing players to constantly change decks and names and gyms before game start
next: tooltip controls

6/12/2013
doesn't look like multiple client pages are possible
doing deck loading, need to try catch file io
the '?' is for null/undefined vs. eval to 0
added new error message handler client side
next: make everything modals

6/11/2013
client side needs the following 
	root = exports ? this
	root.foo = -> 'Hello World'
reason? no clue. it just needs it for functions
i can't believe i forgot to join 'lobby' UGH.
redundant to send chats to yourself
socket.io doesn't support coffeescript string variables
gym joining now works more or less
next: split lobby html from game html

6/10/2013
turning gyms into objects
making player establish a name first
adding a lobby to enter gyms from
fascinating: equal sign creates a reference to entire obj.
even more fascinating: deleting only deletes ref
having trouble client side with sending chats. 
next: have a working chat room in main lobby
ambitious: implement choosing and joining rooms

today turned Player and Pokemon into classes instead of random objects
put all the random functions into the player class where it belongs.
question: why do i have to put an extra 'this' at the end of an object?
when calling a function w/o parameters, don't forget the parenthesis
to call something within a class, just use @
majority of bugs came from paranthesis and functions w/ node being confused
next: implement chat rooms
