so...
enter the website and you're in the main chat (no games here... enter your name! - modal to request name)
room should be populated with a list of gyms to join (with number of people in gym and status of each gym)
or you can create your own gym (create gym button, modal form for gym name, check if gym already exists!)
or you can continue chatting

if entering a gym, trainer name carries over
two trainers per gym
later (option to observe a gym)
send game state broadcast to non-trainers, option to view from any side of table

upon entering gym enter deck name to load deck
pick starting pokemon by click and drag to positions
click pokemon and drag to active/bench
accept iff pokemon is basic
accept iff not already populated
when accepted check
click "ready" when done choosing active/bench pokemon

server tells client to render a finish choosing button
client side check fails if nothing populated in active pokemon list
each drag and drop visually appends to div by default, but do it by script
finish choosing sends to server where player decided to bench and set pokemon

click finish choosing button
wait for other player
on both players finished, start game, pick starting player
